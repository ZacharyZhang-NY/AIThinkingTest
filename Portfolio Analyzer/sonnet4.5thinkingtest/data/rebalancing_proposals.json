    "pros": [
      "Sharpe ratio improves 60% (0.45 → 0.72) - significant risk-adjusted improvement",
      "Eliminates SOXX redundancy (NVDA overlap removed)",
      "QQQ provides diversified tech exposure (100 stocks vs single names)",
      "VTV adds value/defensive characteristics, low correlation to growth",
      "Cash buffer doubled to 10% - meaningful dry powder",
      "Tech concentration reduced to 58% - more balanced",
      "Reduces JEPQ (option-capped upside) while keeping JEPI for income"

    "cons": [
      "Higher turnover (32%) increases transaction costs",
      "Complete exit from SOXX may trigger capital gains if held at profit",

      "eliminate_soxx": "SOXX creates 16.47% total NVDA exposure (15% direct + 1.47% via SOXX holdings). By keeping NVDA direct, we maintain conviction but eliminate redundancy. QQQ provides semiconductor exposure via ~10% allocation to NVDA/AVGO/AMD without concentration.",

      "reduce_jepq": "JEPQ caps upside via covered calls while taking full downside. In AI boom scenario, NVDA could rise 50% but JEPQ captures only 15-18%. Reducing to 5% maintains some option income while freeing capital for uncapped upside.",

      "add_qtq": "Provides broad Nasdaq-100 exposure (100 holdings) with lower single-stock risk. Captures tech upside without concentration. Expense ratio 0.20% is reasonable.",

      "increase_sgov": "10% cash buffer allows tactical opportunities, reduces portfolio beta, provides cushion in drawdowns. At 4.2% yield, not a drag on returns."

  "recommendation": {
    "preferred_plan": "Plan B - Balanced Growth",
    "reasoning": [
      "Sharpe ratio improvement (0.72 vs 0.59) justifies higher turnover",
      "Addresses fundamental structural issues (semiconductor redundancy, sector concentration)",
      "Better downside protection (10% cash vs 9%) and sector diversification",
      "More aligned with 'moderate' risk budget - Plan A remains too aggressive",
      "Long-term portfolio efficiency gains outweigh short-term transaction costs"
    ],

    "execution_notes": [
      "Review tax implications of SOXX sale - consider tax-loss harvesting if underwater",
      "Execute in two tranches: (1) Sell SOXX/JEPQ, buy SGOV/VTV, (2) Add QQQ, increase MSFT",
      "Consider limit orders for illiquid positions to minimize slippage",
      "Time execution around earnings releases (NVDA earnings Nov 19) to avoid volatility"
    ],

    "caveats": [
      "Target Sharpe ratio of 1.0 is aspirational - would require 50%+ fixed income allocation",
      "Both plans assume historical correlations persist - may break in regime changes",
      "Option income (JEPI/JEPQ) is variable and depends on volatility levels",
      "Plans optimize for risk-adjusted returns, not maximum absolute returns"
