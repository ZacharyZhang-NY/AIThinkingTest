## Implementation Plan

- **Action:** Increase allocation to dividend-focused ETFs (JEPI/JEPQ)
- **Rationale:** Current yield of 2.8% is below target for income generation
- **Expected Impact:** Increase portfolio yield to 3.5-4.5%

**3. Portfolio Rebalancing (Priority: Regular)**
- **Action:** Implement quarterly rebalancing with 5% deviation bands
- **Rationale:** Maintain target allocations and risk profile
- **Expected Impact:** Consistent risk-return profile over time
